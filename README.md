# Sleep and Health Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between sleep patterns and various health metrics. By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, the project uncovers insights about how sleep impacts physical and mental health.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To understand how sleep duration, quality, and patterns influence physical and mental well-being.
- **Key Insights**: The analysis explores correlations between sleep data and health indicators such as stress, weight, and daily activity levels.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**:
  - Visualization of sleep trends (e.g., average sleep duration and quality).
  - Correlation analysis between sleep metrics and health indicators.
- **Health Insights**:
  - Impact of sleep on stress levels and mood.
  - Patterns in sleep quality across different age groups and genders.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Interactive charts and plots for a clearer understanding of data trends.
